# Action Keeper

Action Keeper is a platform for creating, managing, and verifying poker staking agreements. Our mission is to bring trust, transparency, and simplicity to the world of poker staking, eliminating the confusion and disputes that can arise from informal deals.

**Our Goal:** To be the industry-standard tool for poker players and backers, providing a secure, non-custodial platform that standardizes agreements and provides tamper-evident proof of terms.

# ActionKeeper

Mobile-first **poker staking agreement** app focused on **revenue-first MVP**:
- Generate a staking agreement (structured terms)
- Produce a **tamper-evident** receipt (hash + QR verify)
- Monetize via **paid contract generation** (Stripe) and later add Trip Planner + affiliate

## MVP Scope (Phase 1: Poker Staking)
**Primary feature:** Paid contract generation + verification  
**Non-custodial:** ActionKeeper never holds funds; it standardizes agreements and provides proof artifacts.

### Negotiation Safeguards (New Requirements)
- Every agreement starts as a **shared draft** that can be viewed via link or QR, but it is *not binding* until both parties acknowledge identical payout terms.
- The database must persist each revision (e.g., “10% of total payout” vs. “10% of net profit”) and clearly mark who proposed it and when they confirmed.
- Counter-offers stay visible side-by-side so user A and user B can converge without confusion; ActionKeeper only generates the final receipt after both select the same option.
- Receipts must embed the canonical promise text, due date/event date, stake percentage, bullet cap, and payout basis so future disputes (like dilution on multi-bullet entries) can be resolved instantly.

Planned features by phase:
- Phase 1 (Revenue MVP): Contract Builder → Pay → PDF + Hash + QR Verify → Vault/List
- Phase 2: Trip Planner (budget + required % sale) + affiliate links
- Phase 3: Verified Resume (optional, later)

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js (App Router), mobile-first web
- Backend: FastAPI
- DB: Postgres
- Local Dev: Docker Compose monorepo

## Running Locally (Current Testing Flow)
1. Ensure Docker Desktop (or another Docker engine) is running; Compose cannot download Postgres without it.
2. `cp .env.example .env` and set:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000`
   - `VERIFY_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000`
   - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<random-test-secret>`
   - `API_TOKEN=dev-token`
   - optional: `ARTIFACTS_DIR=artifacts`, `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=200`
3. Apply migrations once before bringing up the stack (this prevents the `agreements.payment_id does not exist` error):
   ```bash
   # If you changed DB credentials and see "password authentication failed",
   # remove the old volume first:
   docker compose down
   docker volume rm action-keeper_postgres_data
   docker compose up -d db
   docker compose run --rm backend alembic upgrade head
   ```
4. Start the full stack and rebuild images when backend code changes:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build db backend frontend
   ```
   Watch `docker compose logs backend` for a clean "Application startup complete" message; migration failures (missing `script_location`) mean the container was launched before the latest code—rebuild and retry.
5. Frontend dev server tasks (linting, `npm run dev`, etc.) must run from `frontend/`; running them at the repo root triggers `ENOENT` for `package.json`.
6. Manual smoke test loop while Docker is up:
   - `curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health`
   - `POST /api/v1/payments/checkout` with `Authorization: Bearer dev-token`
   - `POST /api/v1/payments/webhook` with `X-Webhook-Secret`
   - `POST /api/v1/agreements` supplying the paid `payment_id`
   - `GET /api/v1/agreements` and `/api/v1/agreements/{id}/artifact`
   Keep an eye on backend logs; 404s from the webhook or 402 responses from agreements indicate the payment flow is still being wired up.

### 2026-02-25 Snapshot
- **Negotiation-ready schema & migrations:** ORM models now capture payout basis, markup, event dates, counter metadata, and funds logs. The Alembic migration (`20260225_negotiation_fields`) creates these columns plus an `agreement_revisions` table. Running the migration still blocks on aligning Postgres credentials, so the backend currently fails with `psycopg.OperationalError: password authentication failed for user "admin"` until the DB volume is recreated with `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres`.
- **Frontend split by persona:** `/seller` hosts the Player Offer Composer (freeze-out template, markup slider, counter-response notes) while `/buyer` renders the Agreement Vault with filters. “Send Offer” now submits a single request; payment buttons were removed pending real checkout integration.
- **Open issues:** 
  - Postgres password alignment remains unresolved; follow the volume reset steps above if migrations fail.
  - Buyer-side counters are not yet wired to the backend; the UI only provides guidance/placeholders.
  - QR receipts still render text-only verification URLs; embedding an actual QR image is scoped for the next iteration once artifacts regenerate successfully.

## Repository Structure

This repository is a lightweight monorepo with a clear separation between **backend domain logic** and **frontend mobile-first UI**.  
It is designed for **TDD-first development**, SQLite-safe testing, and future PostgreSQL production deployment.

### Directory responsibilities

**Repo root**
- `.env.example`: environment variable template
- `docker-compose.yml`: local orchestration for backend + frontend
- `.vscode/`: editor configuration for consistent linting and testing

**Backend (`backend/`)**
- `app/main.py`: FastAPI application entrypoint
- `app/api/v1/`: versioned HTTP endpoints
- `app/schemas/`: Pydantic request/response contracts
- `app/repositories/`: persistence layer (DB access only, no business rules)
- `app/services/`: service layer (business rules; orchestrates repositories)
- `app/db/`: database configuration and SQLAlchemy setup
  - `base.py`: Declarative Base
  - `types.py`: dialect-safe types (SQLite tests / Postgres prod)
  - `models/`: ORM table definitions (single source of truth)
- `tests/`: pytest suite (SQLite in-memory)
- `requirements.txt`: backend dependencies

**Frontend (`frontend/`)**
- `src/app/`: Next.js App Router
- `layout.tsx`: root layout
- `page.tsx`: landing page
- `Dockerfile`: frontend container build

This structure enforces strict separation between API, persistence, and UI, and supports incremental TDD-driven expansion (payments, trip planner, generic P2P agreements).

## Current Progress

**Status as of today (2026-02-25):**

| Part | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 — Foundation | ✅ Stable | Monorepo + health check verified locally. |
| 2 — Domain Models | ✅ Stable | Agreements/events repositories pass unit tests. |
| 3 — Service Layer | ✅ Stable | Business rules + event emission implemented. |
| 4 — API Contracts | ✅ Stable | CRUD endpoints live, protected by `Authorization: Bearer dev-token`. Counter-offer workflow is tracked in the backlog. |
| 5 — Tamper-Evident Receipt | ⚠️ In progress | Hashing + verify endpoint exist, but QR codes are text-only and still waiting on visual rendering plus Prod verification tests. |
| 6 — PDF Artifact Generation | ⚠️ In progress | Deterministic PDFs save to `ARTIFACTS_DIR`, yet migrations must run before `agreement_id` → artifact lookups succeed. |
| 7 — Payments (Revenue MVP) | ⚠️ In progress | Checkout/webhook services are scaffolded, but the `payments` tables and `agreements.payment_id` column require the Alembic migration; until that lands, `/api/v1/agreements` returns HTTP 402/500. |
| 8 — Mobile Contract Builder | ⚠️ In progress | Seller/Buyer pages exist (player offer composer + buyer vault), but counters and backend wiring are pending. |
| 9 — Audit & Ops | 🚧 Not started | Rate limiting, structured logging, auth hardening queued. |
|10 — Expansion Hooks | 🚧 Not started | Trip Planner + affiliate scaffolding queued. |

**What is already working today:**
- FastAPI boots locally and exposes `/api/v1/health` and agreement CRUD when the DB schema matches the ORM.
- Alembic assets (`backend/alembic`) exist; running `alembic upgrade head` inside the backend container unblocks payment/receipt experiments.
- Deterministic PDFs and verification URLs are generated on the backend; embedding an actual QR image plus negotiation metadata is a known follow-up.
- Docker Compose remains the canonical way to stand up Postgres + API + Next.js for manual testing.

## Roadmap: Parts 1–10 (TDD-Gated)

Each part must pass **unit tests → quick QA → integration tests** before moving forward.

### Part 1 — Project Foundation (Baseline) ✅
- Repository structure (monorepo)
- Docker Compose (frontend, backend, DB)
- Health check endpoint (`/api/v1/health`)
- CI-ready test setup (pytest, basic fixtures)

**Outcome:** System boots locally and is observable.

---

### Part 2 — Core Domain Models & Repositories ✅
- Agreement domain model
- Event (audit log) domain model
- Repository layer (CRUD, append-only events)
- SQLite-safe types for testing, Postgres-ready for prod

**Outcome:** Domain persistence works and is fully unit-tested.

---

### Part 3 — Service Layer (Business Rules) ✅
- Agreement creation service
- Default rules (status, versions, timestamps)
- Event emission on state changes
- Validation beyond schemas (domain-level)

**Outcome:** Business logic isolated and testable.

---

### Part 4 — API Contracts (Agreements) ✅
- Create agreement endpoint
- List / retrieve agreement endpoints
- Request/response schemas stabilized
- Error handling + HTTP semantics

**Outcome:** Frontend can create and read agreements via API.

---

### Part 5 — Tamper-Evident Receipt ✅
- Deterministic agreement hashing
- Hash persistence + verification logic
- Public verify endpoint (read-only)
- QR payload structure defined

**Outcome:** Agreements are cryptographically verifiable.

---

### Part 6 — PDF Artifact Generation ✅
- Agreement → PDF rendering
- Embed hash + verification URL
- Deterministic layout for consistency
- Store artifact metadata + download endpoint

**Outcome:** Shareable, receipt-like contract artifact exists.

---

### Part 7 — Payments (Revenue MVP) ✅
- Stripe-style Checkout session scaffolding
- Paid contract generation gate enforced by `payment_id`
- Webhook handling (idempotent secret validation)
- Payment → agreement linkage surfaced via APIs

**Outcome:** App generates real revenue.

---

### Part 8 — Frontend Contract Builder (Mobile-First)
- Agreement input flow (mobile UX)
- Payment flow integration
- Contract list / vault view
- QR scan / verify entry points

**Outcome:** End-to-end user flow is usable on phone.

---

### Part 9 — Audit, Hardening, and Ops
- Event timeline view (per agreement)
- Rate limiting & basic auth hardening
- Structured logging
- Config separation (dev / prod)

**Outcome:** Production-readiness baseline.

---

### Part 10 — Expansion Hooks
- Trip Planner domain scaffolding
- Affiliate link placeholders
- Generic “agreement” abstraction (non-poker reuse)
- Migration readiness (Alembic)

**Outcome:** Platform is extensible beyond poker staking.

---

**Monetization Checkpoint:**  
Revenue must be observable by **Part 7**.  
All later parts must not break paid contract generation.
