# Action Keeper: Blueprint

This document outlines the project's mission, goals, and the design for its promotional website.

## Part 1: README.md Revision

To make the project's purpose clear to all audiences, I will add the following section to the top of the `README.md` file.

# Action Keeper

Action Keeper is a platform for creating, managing, and verifying poker staking agreements. Our mission is to bring trust, transparency, and simplicity to the world of poker staking, eliminating the confusion and disputes that can arise from informal deals.

**Our Goal:** To be the industry-standard tool for poker players and backers, providing a secure, non-custodial platform that standardizes agreements and provides tamper-evident proof of terms.

## Part 2: Promotional Website Plan

The existing "Lotto Generator" will be replaced with a modern, professional landing page to attract and inform potential users.

### **Design & Aesthetics**

*   **Theme:** Modern, clean, and trustworthy with a professional dark theme.
*   **Fonts:** A clean, sans-serif font like 'Inter' or 'Manrope' for readability.
*   **Visuals:** Use high-quality icons and subtle background textures. I will generate or source appropriate icons.
*   **Interactivity:** Smooth-scrolling, and subtle animations on buttons and feature cards.

### **Website Structure & Content**

The website will be a single-page layout with the following sections, with all content derived from the technical `README.md`:

1.  **Hero Section:**
    *   **Headline:** "Action Keeper: The Future of Poker Staking Agreements."
    *   **Sub-headline:** "Create, manage, and verify secure, tamper-evident staking deals. Focus on the game, not the handshake."
    *   **Call to Action (CTA):** A button labeled "Join the Waitlist."

2.  **Problem/Solution Section:**
    *   **Headline:** "Tired of Handshake Deals Gone Wrong?"
    *   **Content:** Briefly explain the risks of informal agreements (disputes, lack of proof) and how Action Keeper provides a clear, verifiable solution.

3.  **Key Features Section:**
    *   Showcases three core features with icons and brief descriptions:
        *   **Secure Shared Drafts:** "Collaborate on terms with a clear revision history before locking in the deal."
        *   **Tamper-Evident Receipts:** "Generate a unique, verifiable receipt with a QR code and cryptographic hash."
        *   **PDF Artifacts:** "Get a professional, downloadable PDF of your final agreement for your records."

4.  **Screenshot Loop Section:**
    *   **Headline:** "See It In Action."
    *   **Content:** A gallery that automatically loops through placeholder screenshots of the application. This will include navigation buttons (Previous/Next) for manual control.
    *   **Placeholders:** Since I cannot generate real screenshots, I will use SVG-based placeholders with labels like "Player Offer Composer," "Agreement Vault," and "Verified QR Receipt" to represent the key UI elements mentioned in the `README.md`.

5.  **How It Works Section:**
    *   A simple, 3-step visual guide:
        1.  **Create:** Build an agreement with structured terms.
        2.  **Finalize:** Negotiate and lock in the terms with all parties.
        3.  **Verify:** Receive a secure, verifiable artifact.

6.  **Footer & Final CTA:**
    *   A final "Join the Waitlist" section.
    *   Links to social media (placeholders).
    *   Copyright information.

### **Technical Implementation**

*   **HTML:** A new `index.html` with semantic structure for the sections above.
*   **CSS:** A completely new `style.css` using CSS variables for a consistent and easily maintainable theme. It will be fully responsive and mobile-first.
*   **JavaScript:** A new `main.js` for smooth scrolling and handling future interactivity (like a waitlist form submission). The dark/light theme toggle will be removed to fit the new, focused design.

This plan will result in a professional promotional website that accurately reflects the high quality of the Action Keeper application.
